# Autogram SHA256

On Hacker News, there was a [post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19003644) showing SHA256 hashes that included a segment of their input strings.

As a result, I developed scripts in Python, Go, and C# to uncover additional SHA256 hashes with this characteristic.

If you stumble upon any more captivating discoveries while tinkering with the code, please don't hesitate to incorporate them and submit a pull request.
