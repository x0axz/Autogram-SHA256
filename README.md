# Autogram SHA256

On Hacker News, there was a [post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19003644) showing SHA256 hashes that included a segment of their input strings.

As a result, I developed scripts in [Python](https://github.com/x0axz/Autogram-SHA256/tree/main/Python), [Go](https://github.com/x0axz/Autogram-SHA256/blob/main/Go/autogram-sha256.go), and [C#](https://github.com/x0axz/Autogram-SHA256/blob/main/C%23/autogram-sha256.cs) to discover additional SHA256 hashes with this characteristic.

If you stumble upon any more captivating discoveries while tinkering with the code, please implement them and share them by submitting a pull request.

## Example
